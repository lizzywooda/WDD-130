                The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination by direct providers of housing, such as landlords and real
                estate
                companies as well as other entities, such as municipalities, banks or other lending institutions and
                homeowners'
                insurance companies whose discriminatory practices make housing unavailable to persons because of race or
                color,
                religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability. Because of this law ESAs are allowed to stay
                in
                any form of housing regardless of the housing's rules on animals. This only applies to properly documented
                ESAs
                only. Landlords are not allowed to charge a renter more because they have an ESA. This also applies to
                college
                housing and dorms. A landlord cannot refuse you housing simply based on your ESA. The law states that
                landlords
                must attempt to make reasonable accommodations for your ESA, even if a property has a “no pets” policy.
                However,
                there are certain situations in which a landlord can legitimately refuse housing for you and your emotional
                support animal. If allowing your ESA would create undue financial or administrative stress on the housing
                provider, they can deny the request. Large animals such as horses or llamas may also be refused, on the
                grounds
                of unavailable space. ESAs must not be disruptive or dangerous in any way, and you are responsible for any
                damage they may cause to the property. If your emotional support animal is found to have a negative impact
                on
                the health, safety, property, or quality of life of other tenants, the landlord can ask you to leave.
