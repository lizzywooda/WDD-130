    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>There are so many questions about what an Emotional Support Animal or ESA is. Many people don't know where ESAs
      are allowed. There are also many questions about who needs an ESA and the difference between a service animal and
      an ESA. I hope to make a website to help answer questions about ESAs. The website will be able to let people know
      about many different parts of ESAs and provide additional links to other informational websites so the user can
      learn more if they would like. I hope this website can help inform and educate about ESAs.</p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>The audience is anyone who has questions about ESAs. This could include landlords that have tenants that have an
      ESA. Many people know about ESAs but not all the rules that come with them. Store owners often wonder if ESAs are
      allowed in stores. This website is also for people who are thinking about getting an ESA or an ESA has been
      recommended to then. The age of people who might want to visit this website could range from 12 to 102.I do not
      think people under 12 would want to know this information. The majority of people who would visit a site like this
      proboly have limited knowledge of ESAs.</p> <!-- change this -->

      What is an ESA
      An emotional support animal, also referred to as an ESA, is a designated companion animal that provides comfort
      and support to a person dealing with a diagnosed emotional, mental, or psychological disability. An ESA can also
      be called an assistance animal or support animal, and helps its owner or handler manage the symptoms of their
      mental or emotional condition. To be officially categorized as an ESA, the owner and animal must have the proper
      documentation in the form of an ESA Letter.

      The difference between ESAs and service animals
      While ESAs are like service animals in some ways, there are many differences between the two.
      ESAs do not perform a specific task or job; instead, their purpose is to offer relief in challenging situations.
      Service animals help their owner complete daily tasks. Service animals undergo intense training that enables them
      to help with specific functions and receive special certification upon completion. Service animals are allowed
      anywhere their owner is. ESAs are only allowed where all animals are allowed with the exception of housing. ESAs
      can be any animal that does not cause harm to people or other animals and is able to behave in public.

      Where are ESAs allowed
      ESAs are allowed anywhere a normal pet would be allowed. Unlike service animals an ESA is not allowed in public
      spaces that don't allow animals. ESAs are for providing comfort in your living condition that is why they are not
      allowed in spaces that other animals are not allowed. People who always have a need for an animal with them
      usually have a Psychiatric Service Dog. A business owner is alowed to ask an ESA to leave their property at
      anytime with the exception of housing.

    <h3>Who Has ESAs</h3>
    <p>
      Who has ESAs?
    There is a wide range of mental and emotional conditions that may qualify a person for an emotional support animal. A licensed mental health professional will need to provide an evaluation and diagnosis for someone to get an ESA letter. A few conditions that might qualify someone for an ESA are:
    Panic and anxiety disorders
    Depression
    Post-traumatic stress disorder
    Intellectual disabilities
    Phobias
    Mood disorders
    (Set links for each condition to an informational website on the condition)

    How to get an ESA
    A licensed mental health professional can provide you with an ESA letter if they see fit. The letter must include their official letterhead, a dated signature, and other specific details that apply to your situation. A mental health professional will not provide an ESA letter unless they think it is needed. A good first step to acquiring an ESA letter, if you believe it to be something that would help your situation, would be to talk to our doctor.

    <h3>ESAs and Housing</h3>
    <p>
      Housing and ESAs
    The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination by direct providers of housing, such as landlords and real estate companies as well as other entities, such as municipalities, banks or other lending institutions and homeowners’ insurance companies whose discriminatory practices make housing unavailable to persons because of race or color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability. Because of this law ESAs are allowed to stay in any form of housing regardless of the housing’s rules on animals. This only applies to properly documented ESAs only. Landlords are not allowed to charge a renter more because they have an ESA. This also applies to college housing and dorms. A landlord cannot refuse you housing simply based on your ESA. The law states that landlords must attempt to make reasonable accommodations for your ESA, even if a property has a “no pets” policy. However, there are certain situations in which a landlord can legitimately refuse housing for you and your emotional support animal. If allowing your ESA would create undue financial or administrative stress on the housing provider, they can deny the request. Large animals such as horses or llamas may also be refused, on the grounds of unavailable space. ESAs must not be disruptive or dangerous in any way, and you are responsible for any damage they may cause to the property. If your emotional support animal is found to have a negative impact on the health, safety, property, or quality of life of other tenants, the landlord can ask you to leave.
