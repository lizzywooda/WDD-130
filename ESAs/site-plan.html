      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>There are so many questions about what an Emotional Support Animal or ESA is. Many people don't know where ESAs are allowed. There are also many questions about who needs an ESA and the difference between a service animal and an ESA. I hope to make a website to help answer questions about ESAs. The website will be able to let people know about many different parts of ESAs and provide additional links to other informational websites so the user can learn more if they would like. I hope this website can help inform and educate about ESAs.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience is anyone who has questions about ESAs. This could include landlords that have tenants that have an ESA. Many people know about ESAs but not all the rules that come with them. Store owners often wonder if ESAs are allowed in stores. This website is also for people who are thinking about getting an ESA or an ESA has been recommended to then. The age of people who might want to visit this website could range from 12 to 102.I do not think people under 12 would want to know this information. The majority of people who would visit a site like this proboly have limited knowledge of ESAs.</p>  <!-- change this -->
