        <h2>Who has ESAs?</h2>
        There is a wide range of mental and emotional conditions that may qualify a person for an emotional support
        animal. A licensed mental health professional will need to provide an evaluation and diagnosis for someone to
        get an ESA letter. A few conditions that might qualify someone for an ESA are:
        Panic and anxiety disorders
        Depression
        Post-traumatic stress disorder
        Intellectual disabilities
        Phobias
        Mood disorders
        </p>

        <h2>How to get an ESA</h2>
        A licensed mental health professional can provide you with an ESA letter if they see fit. The letter must
        include their official letterhead, a dated signature, and other specific details that apply to your situation. A
        mental health professional will not provide an ESA letter unless they think it is needed. A good first step to
        acquiring an ESA letter, if you believe it to be something that would help your situation, would be to talk to
        our doctor.
