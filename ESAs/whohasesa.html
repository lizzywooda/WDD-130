                    <h3>Who has ESAs?</h3>
                    There is a wide range of mental and emotional conditions that may qualify a person for an emotional support
                    animal. A licensed mental health professional will need to provide an evaluation and diagnosis for someone to
                    get an ESA letter. A few conditions that might qualify someone for an ESA are:
                    Panic and anxiety disorders
                    Depression
                    Post-traumatic stress disorder
                    Intellectual disabilities
                    Phobias
                    Mood disorders
                </p>

                    <h3>How to get an ESA</h3>
                    A licensed mental health professional can provide you with an ESA letter if they see fit. The letter must
                    include their official letterhead, a dated signature, and other specific details that apply to your situation. A
                    mental health professional will not provide an ESA letter unless they think it is needed. A good first step to
                    acquiring an ESA letter, if you believe it to be something that would help your situation, would be to talk to
                    our doctor.
