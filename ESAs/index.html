          An emotional support animal, also referred to as an ESA, is a
          designated companion animal that provides comfort and support to a
          person dealing with a diagnosed emotional, mental, or psychological
          disability. An ESA can also be called an assistance animal or support
          animal, and helps its owner or handler manage the symptoms of their
          mental or emotional condition. To be officially categorized as an ESA,
          the owner and animal must have the proper documentation in the form of
          an ESA Letter.

        <h2>The difference between ESAs and service animals</h2>
        <p class="midp">
          While ESAs are like service animals in some ways, there are many
          differences between the two. ESAs do not perform a specific task or
          job; instead, their purpose is to offer relief in challenging
          situations. Service animals help their owner complete daily tasks.
          Service animals undergo intense training that enables them to help
          with specific functions and receive special certification upon
          completion. Service animals are allowed anywhere their owner is. ESAs
          are only allowed where all animals are allowed with the exception of
          housing. ESAs can be any animal that does not cause harm to people or
          other animals and is able to behave in public.

        <h2>Where are ESAs allowed</h2>
        <p>
          ESAs are allowed anywhere a normal pet would be allowed. Unlike
          service animals an ESA is not allowed in public spaces that don't
          allow animals. ESAs are for providing comfort in your living condition
          that is why they are not allowed in spaces that other animals are not
          allowed. People who always have a need for an animal with them usually
          have a Psychiatric Service Dog. A business owner is alowed to ask an
          ESA to leave their property at anytime with the exception of housing.
